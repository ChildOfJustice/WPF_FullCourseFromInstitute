1) You need to change the Color of the Thumb inside of the ScrollBar element!
NOT the ScrollViewer!!
2) In order to do this, you need to create your own Template for the ScrollBar
3) Vertical AND Horizontal
4) BUT for some reason I cannot crate my own AdjustedScrollBar with attached property "ThumbColor"
It crashes every time I change the type of the ScrollBar
Also you cannot do it with the ScrollViewer either - it crashes
5) I found a work around:
I did not inherit the AdjustedScrollViewer from the ScrollViewer class
Then, I created a strange type of Attached property - like it did Maxim.
After that I changed in my Template for the ScrollBar the Background property with TemplateBinding to Foreground!!!
It's not good, but when I passing the ThumbColor from ScrollViewer to the ScrollBar as the Foreground color,
I can use this TemplateBinding and change the color of the Thumb without any new control types and it WORKS!
